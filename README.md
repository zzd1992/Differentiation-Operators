# Differentiation-Operators
im2vdiff.m constructs 2D differentiation-operators Dx and Dy discribed in our ICASSP2018 paper 
## TV-SVM: Support Vector Machine with Total Variational Regularization.

The parameters m and n of im2vdiff.m are the size of a matrix.
You can try the following code:
```matlab
[dx, dy] = im2vdiff(4,4);
dx = full(dx); dy = full(dy);
```
